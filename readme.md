primeEverything
================

primeEverything is a Chrome extension that enables you to buy every headline on every page. 


Initial Concept
--------------
Parse webpages and find associated Amazon products, automatically add them to your shopping cart.


Current Version
--------------
This is my first attempt at writing a Chrome extension, working with jQuery, really working with Javascript at all. So it's obnoxiously simple.
